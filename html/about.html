		<p>It's a loooooonnnnngggg story, but in short, I've had a career in tech without being very technical for about 3 or 4 years.  I fell into the industry through a series of jobs which brought me closer and closer to "Bleeding Edge" technology, and I learned enough to explain what these solutions did without every really understanding WHY they worked.</p>
		<p>I tried to learn about the Magic Behind the Curtain, but I did not even know how to begin.  I tried Code Academy, Coursera and am still working through Udacity.  I also belonged to a group in Nashville called "Girl Geeks" - we would meet to code and drink wine, although considerably more wine was drunk than code was created.</p>
		<p>So about 9 months ago, I landed in a job which required me to take a deep dive into antiquated, proprietary systems.  I thought, "Man, I should really apply all this effort to more portable skills." So I found Tech Talent South through a more or less random email and decided to look into the program.  I had a great deal of trepidation about branching off, but after talking to friends who work in the industry I decided that this would be a good way to re-tool and maybe take my career back in a more creative growth direction.</p>
