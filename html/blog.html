		<p>3:58 am I'm doing it!  I'm coding!  Well, kinda, at least.  I watched the Treehouse tutorial and I read through chapter 1.2 of the online book to see how to install Ruby and Rails.  Actually, I saw the magic phrase "to avoid complexity..."  Yes, by all means!  Let's do!  So I sign up for the Cloud9 hosted version.  Then I get stuck and it being so late, there is nothing to do but go to bed for a couple of hours, but I'm off to a good start...</p>

		<p>7:00 am – What to wear to coding class?  Damn, I wish I’d gotten those Tiffany reading glasses now from my optometrist.  As I leave to take Howie to school, I feel super excited, like I’m off to visit a foreign country.  I always feel like this when I get up early because it makes me think of going to the airport!</p>  
		<p>9:00 am – I try to find parking for 75 5th street.  The directions “Try the lot across from the Cheetah” (a notorious strip club) gives me a moment of pause.  I don’t see the Cheetah, but I do manage to park and go into the ADEC building.  Wow!  The AT&T Foundry is in the same building.  Really?  I have been slaving away in a cube trying to figure out archaic systems for the last 9 months and they have had this cool space all hidden away?  With Ocatane Coffee in the lobby and all?  I’m not a girl to cuss, but “FU AT&T!”</p>

		<p>So I find the class, already in full swing.  I’m late due to a school meeting for my son, Howie.  First day, not the best day to be late!  I’m the only one in the class with a PC.  I feel like a decrepit dinosaur, schlepping my way to the tar pit of Dell and HP as the emerging young mammals sprint by with their paper thin Apples tucked under an evolving arm.  RRRAAAWWWWRRR, battery almost dead already and I have to get up and conspicuously walk across the room to plug in. </p> 

		<p>Aaron, our main instructor, is at the head of the class deftly entering commands and jumping from screen to screen like some kind of laptop Mozart.  He hits a snag, and stops to cut and paste the error message into Google, finds the solution and cuts and pastes the answer back into his window.  Are y’all all following this?  Looks like, however I am completely lost. </p>

		<p>There are about  8 students in the class, seated two to a table.  I share a table with Tiffany, a former military IT professional who now runs a company that does laundry and dry cleaning for GA Tech.  She keeps uninstalling Rails (or her machine does).   At one point, Tiffany says under her breath, “I’m completely lost.”  I instantly feel  a kindredness, a sisterhood with her!  I think most of us are just going to have to get used to the feeling until we get a little more conversant. </p>

 		<p> We are set up at tables of two.  Our table is the Zone of Shame.  No, the "less complex” solution is apparently not always the best. I am the only one who read the instructions to say we should do everything on Cloud9 - a virtual platform for Ruby on Rails.  Also, with my PC, the instructions are slightly different – not a stumbling block to an experienced programmer, but to me its like Mt. Everest.  Sam, one of the back up instructors, comes up to check on me.  Then he sits down beside me.  Eventually over the course of the next two hours, Sam makes me come and sit in the back of the room beside him.  I’m really frustrated at first, even a little with Sam, who’s doing his best to help.  I feel like the problem child who has to go sit next to the teacher.  Sam is incredibly patient, but its just a difficult process, and like most difficult processes, you just have to surrender and let it happen.</p>

		<p>We are completely stymied by trying to make files open in Superb Text.  After class I go to office hours.  Office hours are 11-2 every day.  I think I’ll be staying after class a lot!  Luckily they have nice offices!  Sam and I sweat the Superb Text issue for a few more eons when Aaron comes over and clicks a couple of buttons.  Problem solved Maestro! Just a minor difference between PC and MAC commands, it turns out.  I'm not an idiot!  Well, not completely!</p>
	<div id="header">Day One Monday, October 20,2014 - UPDATE</div>
		<p> I go to the evening Part-Time Ruby class.  Its a little less comprehensive than the day version.  Many of the students seem to be sponsored by their employers.  Unlike the day version, which is about 50/50 men and women, the evening version is ALL female, except for Richard (different Richard) </p>
		<p>Sam is teaching this class.  It seems to cover the same material, but its easier to understand this time around.  Maybe because its (dare I say?) becoming more familiar?  By the time 9:00 pm rolls around, I feel much better and the material seems to be sinking in.  At least I am able to navigate better between the screens.</p>
